"""
We use comparison operators in situations where we compare a variable with a value.

if temperature is greater than 30
    it's a hot day
otherwise if it's less than 10
    it's a cold day
otherwise
    it's neither hot nor cold

In comparison operator/relational operator, we've 6 different types of operators:
- Equal to (==)
- Greater Than (>)
- Greater Than or Equal To (>=)
- Less Than (<)
- Less Than or Equal To (<=)
- Not Equal To (!=)

but we have to know the difference between 'Equal to' operator and 'Assignment'
operator -
In 'Equal to' operator, we compare a variable with a value using double equal sign (==)
whereas in assignment operator, we use equal sign (=) to assign a value to a variable.
